    # - Types are similar to Java classes.
    #   - Types borrow additional features from JSON Schema, XSD, and more expressive object oriented languages.
    # - You can define types that inherit from other types.
    #   - Multiple inheritance is allowed.
    # - Types are split into four families: external, object, array, and scalar.
    # - Types can define two types of members: **properties** and **facets**. Both are inherited.
    #   - **Properties** are regular, object oriented properties.
